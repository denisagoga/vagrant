# creating a local Linux lab environment

1-Install an SSH Client, Git Bash (windows users)
2-Install VirtualBox (All Users)
3-Install Vagrant (All Users)
4-Start a Command Line Session (All Users)

5-Add a Box to Vagrant
vagrant box add centos/7

6-Create a Working Folder
mkdir shell

7-Change into the Working Folder
cd shell

8-Create a Vagrant Project Folder and change into that folder
mkdir testproject
cd testproject

9-Create the Vagrant configuration file (Vagrantfile)
vagrant init centos/7

10-Create Your First Virtual Machine
vagrant up

11-Confirm That It's Running
vagrant status

# multiple virtual machines

12-Open the vagrant file 'Vagrantfile'  with the text editor VIM to add two virtual machines and asign them a host name an ip addr
Below: config.vm.box="centos/7"  
Add:
config.vm.define "Server1" do | Server1|
ServerOne.vm.hostname = "Server1"
ServerOne.vm.network "private_network", ip: "x.x.x.x1"
end

config.vm.define "Server2" do | Server2|
ServerTwo.vm.hostname = "Server2"
ServerTwo.vm.network "private_network", ip: "x.x.x.x2"
end

13.Save the changes and start the VM-s
vagrant up

14.Check their status 
vagrant status

15-Connect to the server1 virtual machine to confirm that it’s working and then exit it.
vagrant ssh Server1
exit

16.Connect to the Server2 virtual machine to confirm that it’s working. While you are logged into the Server2
VM, ping the Server1 VM to prove that the two virtual machines can communicate with each other over
the network.

$vagrant ssh Server2
$ping -c 3 x.x.x.x1
